I mean... let me change that. 19 [reffering to 2019], um, when COVID hit. Everything\nstarted changing around. From everyone getting sick, you see more depression, you know in people.\nMore killing. I never thought I would see my town turn into a disaster due to COVID. Where everybody\nwas locked in and people just thought, you know, getting out of control. Other than that, the crime has\nnever been... that I I was aware of and living here where I was scared to go places. Or just to approach\na young child and to correct them. You know, right now you got kids that you don't even know their\nparents anymore. Where they're coming from. Because it's not just the kids, it's parents too. That bad\ndepression hit us as, I would say mind wise. You know, mental state. And you see it every day. And this\nis when everything started changing around 2019. Harvey [reffering to Hurrican Harvey], didn't bother\nus as much. We got hit with Harvey, but everybody made a comeback. But when COVID hit, it just took\na lot away from the family. You know, just totally Beaumont, Beaumont period. It took a lot away from\neverybody. Yes."

This is when everybody started,\nyou know, lockdown.Llockdown, people came in, a lot of people didn't understand lockdown. You know,\nthat was the thing. Our city never been in lockdown as long as the years I've been here. And there was\na mental challenge for a lot of people and young people. So you look at that, and you can't go\nanywhere. Your parents telling you, \"You're not going anywhere because it's a lock down.\" You still\ncan't go and just stay at home. You're not going because there's a sickness, because you got elderly\ngrandmothers in your house. You can't go down there and play outside still, because COVID. COVID\nlocked everybody because nobody wants to get sick; people start dying. So you imagine what the\nparents, barely can go to start with their head at home. When you think about Spectrum or you\ndownload any game on TV. So you imagine that. And always, games the kids was playing while some\nother students still had to go to work when they was in school. That was some mother's babysitter.\nBecause 30 minutes the mom is coming home when the kid was getting out of school. So you imagine\nthat mom all day, the one that's forced like me a nurse first responder. Leaving that child at home and\ndidn't have a choice but to work because you first respond. You understand what I'm saying? You just\ncan't take off when you're a first responser. So nobody was prepared for this. Not even the kids, not\nbeing able to see different. So you look at this. Light bill going up at home. Water bill going up at home.\nGroceries. And then these kids are locked down all day. Not able to see they friends; not even to talk to\nthem because all kids didn't have cell phones. And then it came where okay, they decided to give them,\nthe year before, but- nobody had the internet when they needed the tablet when school started. So\nsome parents couldn't afford the internet. So the only way they was able to connect on an internet, if\nsomebody next door allowed them to help that. You know they cope. So you imagine them kids in that\nhouse all day. And another one didn't they also put what is suppose day of school online"

If you have\nthe time I have, just have one last request for you before we conclude our interview. One of the\noverarching research questions through the Home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in\nTexas. As part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief\npassage, which would only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that\nwas created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans\nreading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to\ntrack how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage\nout loud?"

I'm going back- and we'd swing out wide over the\nswimming hole and drops into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In, in the spring\nI'd fly kites, and on the summer nights we catch fireflies, but we call them \"lightening bugs\". Once in a\nwhile- I'm trying to see for you- we'd have fights with our corn cobs and pinecones. In the winter we'd\nbuild a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was, I guess I\nwas, I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work into Dallas at a Firestone tire store. I didn't like city\nlife, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods:\nfried okra, Hoppin', Hoppin' John, what kind? Hoppin' John, that the rice and black eyed peas, and\npecan pie. We had lots, lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died,\nMama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the\ncity, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I grip about, gripe about city life and talk about\nmoving to the country. My oldest child said, \"Daddy that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I\nalmost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing but I try to make sure we don't lose\ntouch with our, our roots. While meanwhile, while we may live in the city, I want my kids to have a good\nfeeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texans. They lost, um, ties of the\nland, the price for progress is too high."
