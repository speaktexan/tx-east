I liked growing up in the country. When my chores\nwere done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a\nrope to a limb of a cypress tree and would swing out right over the swimming hole and drop into the\nwater. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine in the spring I'd fly kites, and on summer nights\nwould catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while, we'd have fights with corncobs or\npinecones. In the winter, we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and\npecans. I guess I was live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't\nlike city life. And for a long time I'd go home every chance I got almost would always put my favorite\nfoods: fried okra, hoppin' John. That's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good\ntimes but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler.\nI'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand\nme when I grew up about city life and talked about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy,\nthat's crazy. I just died if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas\nis changing. But I try to make sure they don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I\nwant my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of place and take pride in being\nTexans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress too high."
