But pretty much everybody knew who you were, or you knew who they were, when you saw him coming in now the stores. So very close, uh well known community of people that knew families for generations, because families lived here for generations, and they didn't move away. There, they stayed here, their kids grew up here, their kids, you know, started raising their families here. And so there wasn't a whole lot of change in in the dynamics of um very equal in race, it was black, white, and Hispanic, primarily, can't say we had any other um Asian or any other type of ethnicity that was really present in the community at that time. Um and everybody got along very well, regardless of race, economic background, or um just jobs or anything like that um so that was back then, now it's a little bit um, you know, a larger population where you have people from all over the world living here. Um back then, you know, it would be odd to hear somebody that was from a different country. You know, you're born in Texas, you raised in Texas, this is where they basically live. So uh very diverse, more of a city now. Um which is a good thing. And um so the population, you I can I can sit in a restaurant downtown or store and used to be able to know people when they walked in, and they would know you. And I could go now and not know a single person in the store or restaurant, which is not a bad thing. It's just, it's how things have changed. So when you do see someone you do know from you know, um it's always a friendly hello. And so it's it's getting to know new people that live here. Um I like to [SMACKS LIPS] hear people talk and when they're in restaurants and stuff like that, and then ask them, I like to ask questions like, Where are you from? Um I'm always interested in where people come from, you know, what made you decide to move to [COMMUNITY NAME]? And that's the question you'd like to ask people. And they're like, oh, you know, they always want to move out the big city or [OTHER COMMUNITY NAME] or a lot of people come from [OTHER COMMUNITY NAME] You know, they think [OTHER COMMUNITY NAME]'s getting overcrowded, or it's just too much. A lot of times it's the schools, the population of the schools is too big for them and they want um [COMMUNITY NAME] [SCHOOL DISTRICT NAME] school district have smaller um populations uh based on their uh high school levels and junior high levels and they, they did that on purpose. They made smaller schools so uh kids would have more opportunities to join clubs and activities where um your [OTHER COMMUNITY NAME] schools are larger. They're probably about double the size of what [SCHOOL DISTRICT NAME] schools are. And so a lot of people, uh if you're trying out for a club or something like that, and they don't have the opportunity, they will move out. We have a lot of people move out just for sports, to the [COMMUNITY NAME] area just to get away from higher population. So that's changed a lot. Um sort of, you know, you're seeing less uh pastures of uh horses and cows and wildflowers and this is where we're at today. This was all rice fields. Where the city hall sits today this this whole [NEIGHBORHOOD NAME] was nothing but rice fields. And so in the winter, you would have the flocks of geese migrating from Canada becoming a neighbor just inundate these these fields you know, be white with the snow geese and uh nowadays you don't see or even hear 'em anymore because there's nowhere for them to land. It's all populated with rooftop. So they, they find different routes to hit South in the winter. So those things like that It's it's the little things like that. [SMACKS LIPS] You know, the sky is at night back then were dark. And so the stars were bright. And uh we played, [SMACKS LIPS] we played a lot of hide and seek at night,  "

And um [SMACKS LIPS] it was just, just the place to go. People learn to swim. I have people still today, you know. Yeah, I remember, you know. We grew up learning how to swim in your, your parent's backyard. So we did that a lot. We played sports. We didn't have uh [SMACKS LIPS] little league or the little, you know, sports leagues that they have now like soccer and baseball. And so we did it on our own, we played late. We're playing football, we're playing in someone's front yard with the football and we're just playing or baseball. The lot across the street from Dozier's was a horse lot.

And we all did, we all wanted parks, you know, wanted restaurants, um grocery stores, you know, more convenience stores for them to shop at locally and certainly to drive into town.

But downtown was an area that had some beautiful old oak trees and the countries that people wanted to kind of preserve. People always wanted to preserve that kind of small town downtown feel. And so there was issues with trying to create a tree ordinance to protect some of the areas. When I bought my property, I live off a boat or it was covered in what is called a Texas thornrose. It is a vine type bush, grows can grow up to like eight feet tall. But it's covered in thorns to learn not just like a rosebush, thorn, it has those long thorns, but multi... many thorns around that. So just walking by or anything it'll grab your shirt it's just like, and so I uh got rid of all that kind of loaded down and brushed it and got rid of all that stuff during that time. And people were taking pictures. Here he, putting stuff out like \"Here he is he's anti trees mowing down all these are trees.\" "

And people that move here, enjoy it, you know, the people that I met some people just last year, moved from Washington State. They said, you know, economy got bad, they took the jump and leap of faith just to trust that they were gonna just move to Texas and hopefully find a job and they did it and they said, it's been the best thing for 'em. But you know, they're like, \"We couldn't wait to get here and we just love being here.\" And this is neat to hear people that you know, are glad to come and be a part of the culture and the pride of being from Texas. I would say... I would say a one because you don't have to be. I mean, like I said, Texas had many flags fly over this state. Before it was its own state. It was based on the Indian and Spanish and so no, my my I tell you, straight out my wife was born and raised in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas. Her mom was Hispanic, her dad was white.

But for people to move to [COMMUNITY NAME], it's definitely a great place to raise a family. If you have safety, and you have uh value in the people and you have value in your property, and you know, all the resources will come in time with growth. But it's a great place to invest. A lot of people would like to move here. A lot of people tell me that a lot of times but just can't afford because of the value of the land and in homes and stuff like that. Um I think there are a lot of communities that have been brought into [COMMUNITY NAME] that have a different economic background that allows people to move here. Back when I was mayor at the time, and on council um. I don't think, I think we might have had two employees that lived in the city of [COMMUNITY NAME] that work for the city. And they were lifelong residents as well. So they were raised here but most of the employees at that time, \"We couldn't live in [COMMUNITY NAME] because we can't afford it\" or find a home that was of the value that they could afford. Because the median age or the median income of a home at that time was around the 350 range or something like that which was quite high for communities so."

People uh when I got out of college, wanting property, I wrote letters, and called people to a lot of the big property owners asking if they would sell just 10 acres, I just wanted 10 acres always just wanted like 10 acres, be big enough. And I thought I knew I would do whatever it needed to reef, just 10 acres off the end of their property. You know, I'll fence it, I'll replant it, I'll do everything. You just sell it to me. People weren't interested in this. You know, they had big ranches and they didn't care. Hundreds of acres they'd care less if, you know, someone wanted to buy a couple acres. But doing that 14 years later, I got a phone call from a realtor from Florida, who was representing her sister in law that lives, she lives in the northern part of Texas, but she owned property here. And there was heir to her from her family. And so there was other heirs that had property adjacent to her property. But she was interested in the settlement at that time. And I had written her a letter, and she kept it for like 14 years and wanted to know at that time if she if I wanted to still buy her property. And so which ended up being a blessing, which we did. It was unreal what she wanted for it at the time and what the price of property was going on at that time. It was you know, couldn't ask for a better blessing than that. But it's that's what's so different about how the value of [COMMUNITY NAME] has always just increased over the years. "

You know, when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler, I lived growing up in the count of the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time, we tied a rope to a land of a cypress tree, and we swing out and wide over the screen swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a livewire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life in for a long time I go home every chance I got mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra hopping John's, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but good home is not the same now, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing but I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of place and a pride and take pride in being Texans. If they're if they lose or our ties to the land, the price of progress is too high. "
