So there are real no day to day operations for the mayor other than that, signing documents, being in appearances for events. And those just kind of come as they come. And so there's really no standard day or anything. Lucky with me. It's an unpaid positions, volunteer position, so I'm not being paid for it. So there's no no, no monetary gain in it.

Because again, I'm part of a body of the city council. It's not just, it's not just me. And I'm just one vote of five. So I would say, and also, finally just trying to find where, where do people get their information? That's always been a real struggle to determine because people will say, Oh, I didn't know about that. Or I didn't know we could do that, or so. And say, Well, we did it on social, we did it by email, we did it in the newspaper, we're done it, you know, I just think a lot of people are just not connected or more are somewhat detached. And maybe they like it that way. But then they don't like it that way whenever something's done that they don't agree with. So trying to find that form of. And I guess it's not going to be for everybody's not going to have the same way of being communicated to or how they get their information. But it would be nice to figure out how to do it better. "

So as part of this project, there's going to be a linguistic researcher, that actually it's myself. That's basically I'll ask you to read a brief passage. And it's basically this passage is a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it so basically, there's law, a lot of people have read this passage and so [PHONE RINGING] then these researchers will use these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking. [PHONE RINGING] And yeah, so if you don't mind would you like to read this passage out loud?"

I liked growing up in the country. My chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In spring I fly kites and on summer nights we catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone car store. I didn't like city life. For a long time I'd go home every chance I've got mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra. Papa John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy dad mom sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of out here in the city. My wife and kids don't understand me when I grew up about city life and talking about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I just died. I have to live on the farm. almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I've tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land have a sense of place and take pride and be in Texas. If they lose our ties and land the price of progress is too high.\" "
