Not able to see they friends; not even to talk to\nthem because all kids didn't have cell phones.

Okay. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, I moved to a\nfarm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores\nwere done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a\nrope to a limb of a cypress tree and would swing out right over the swimming hole and drop into the\nwater. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on the vine in the spring I'd fly kites, and on summer nights\nwould catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while, we'd have fights with corncobs or\npinecones. In the winter, we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and\npecans. I guess I was live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't\nlike city life. And for a long time I'd go home every chance I got almost would always put my favorite\nfoods: fried okra, hoppin' John. That's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good\ntimes but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler.\nI'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand\nme when I grew up about city life and talked about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy,\nthat's crazy. I just died if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas\nis changing. But I try to make sure they don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I\nwant my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of place and take pride in being\nTexans. If they lose our ties to the land, the price of progress too high.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_azle_hl_06252024/canvas/2#t=910,1021"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_azle_hl_06252024/canvas/2/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Thank you.

When I was I went to SFA. And uh- can I digress a minute here? And I'll tell you something, that and this- I don't want to get into politics. But my father came back from World War Two with tuberculosis. He did a lot of stents in the VA hospital, he did nine months, once, six months, once, three months once. And because of that, we didn't have a terribly lot of money. Now we had we never went without. But um- when it came time to look at college, I would have liked to go to University of Texas. To be honest, I don't know if I was smart enough to get in. But there was no money for us. There was nothing and at that point in time, there were no, I mean, this is 1965. There's, you know, if there was any grants or anything, I knew nothing of it. But here's the plan. My dad worked 45 years, at the paper mill here. They had a summer work program. And he said, and I could make enough money, working at the Paper Mill in the summers to pay my tuition and buy my books at SFA. both semesters, I had to live at home. And I worked part time pumping gas. Now the reason I mentioned this is because if you want to do something, you can do it. You just got to figure out a way to make it happen sometimes. But so what happened then, and the Vietnam war was going on. And I was motivated [LAUGHTER} to stay in school, because you could get a deferment because the draft was going on. And then when they finally tried to draft me, I didn't pass the physical. But uh- it's another story for another time. But so I came- I got home. And here's the answer to your question. I had a buddy, a good buddy in high school who was working as a manager at a finance company. And, he, when I got came back from not passing the physical, well he and I were out messing around he said, Hey, what are you gonna do? And I said, I'm not sure I'm not sure at this point. And he said, Hey, I know where there's an opening at a finance company. And I said its plains finance, I don't know if it's even still here, but, or around but uh- long story short, I applied for the the position and I went to work for them as as a collector of past dues. And no, no, he worked for plains finance, let me straighten this up. And I went to work for Home Credit Corporation HCC credit, and they made loans up to $1,500. And they made smaller loans to folks and charged an exorbant interest rate and that sort of thing, but um- but they had a really good training program, they had a good training program relative to collecting past dues. And you didn't get promotions if you didn't pass these uh- programs that they put forth and if you wanted to be promoted, and- um- and so anyway, it was a good it was a good fortunate thing for me. One day though, I was went to lunch, and I had a buddy that I commuted with one semester over to SFA that wants to go with good friend of mine, ran into him at lunch, we were eatin at Dairy Queen. And he went, he was working at the old Lufkin National Bank. That's not here now. And he said, uh- he said, Hey, I'm being promoted. And my job's gonna be open. You're thinking about working for a bank. And I went: yeah it crossed my mind one time, but I never- And so I came into Lufkin National Bank as a trainee, and I worked as a teller. I worked in the accounts. I worked all over the bank, which was really great, and it gave me a good background. And from there, I went to another bank and got into lending.

I'll tell you a quick story. I worked at a little bank at one point and this lady came in who had rheumatoid arthritis. And she had one son that was special. But he could drive. She had another one that was wheelchair bound. And this lady, I don't know how she could function, but she came in. And she said, \"I need to borrow $500 to build a wheelchair ramp at my mobile home for my son in a wheelchair\". So I said, \"You bet\", and I pulled everything up and put it together. I don't think she had any credit. Consequently, it was with- outside my lending authority, if you don't have any credit, or if  you've got bad credit, but I went to the president of the bank was great guy, he's gone. Now. He's deceased. Named *** ****. And I said, here's this lady. He said, You tell her that the bank will pay for it. We'll just do that. And he said \"no wait a minute\". He said, \"You make- make her a loan, charge her a reasonable rate like 10%\", which is nothing on= you don't make anything on $500 10%. \"And if she pays it, she'll build some credit, and she may need something else down the line. And then you'll be in a situation or she'd be in a situation where you can help her\". As it turned out. She paid like, just like nobody's business. And I did make her more loans. And she did get credit established, and she had some credit. And then, in the course of this, uh- this lady developed some cancer on her nose, had to have her nose amputated. I mean, it was just one thing after another. But she was always up. And she came in. And she said, the paper mill, she lived in behind the paper mill, on some property, her property in a mobile home. She said \"they're buying up property around us, and they bought- made me an offer a pretty good offer. But I want to know if I can buy a house, and I found one I want\". I said, \"Absolutely\". And so we uh- just, she was so happy to get those kids in. And as luck as- is- things would to have it, the house was just down the road from where I live. But that lady passed away shortly after and did not get to enjoy it, and that was the saddest part. But to see somebody who was fighting to make... banking is one of the few professions that you- you can have an impact, I think on things like that, and helping people. And you know why I'm talking about this, you know, one of the things that banks, banks are regulated in on many fronts that everybody thinks in terms of safety and soundness. And that's where they come in and check your loans. But there's a lot of other audits by the government. And there's other regulations. One of them is called the Community Reinvestment Act. And the Community Reinvestment Act says, \"bank, you must do some things, in your community to benefit- using your banking knowledge, using your skills to help people who are low income\". So we look for thing- and if you do not, if you don't score well, you can even be monetarily penalized when you're audited on this. And if you want to build branches, you're not going to be able to build branches you're not gonna be able to make acquisitions, nothing. So it's pretty important. They're very serious about it. One of my customers was a warden at the prison, down in ******. And he and I were talking about plans one day he's actually I'll give him the credit he said, Hey, \"we- our prison is the last stop for these guys. They're going to be getting out within two years. Most of them or a year. And they are required to complete a life skills class\". He said \"would you come talk to those classes about what's changed in banking\"? I said \"you bet that's perfect. I mean, they're low to moderate income\". And I enjoyed going. I mean, the first time I went to go through all the gates and through the bars, you're out in the yard with them, and- and then you get in there. But it- And you look at the class and they would be sometimes 15, Sometimes 20 people in the class. You look at one guy and he looks like the kid next door. Look at another guy, and he looks like your grandfather. You know, can't ask them why they're there. If they volunteer, that's fine. But there's always- there was always almost without exception, there were two duds maybe three that would just put their heads down and go to sleep, didn't care don't want to hear. And and I would talk to him about how to open new accounts how to get your credit credit reestablished. I would talk to them if you're going to- thinking about doing a business, here's what you need to do you have questions, and there would be four or five that take notes and have questions. But I felt like- that um- if if some of that helped some of those guys, because I got a lot- they got a steep hill to climb. And- and so that's the kind of things people don't know that that banks do that, uh- And- and we also I went and I used to have a talk, and I would go about every year and talk to kids in high school. And it was about banking primarily but I also worked in one of my deals is kid- please, kids don't drink and drive. I mean, here's what it can cost you, stuff like that. Anyway, that was a long answer but it it banking afforded the opportunity for me to to feel like I was doing something good for somebody much like Little League Baseball. I loved being with those kids. And- and just I had one kid in particular who I started with him when he was six. I moved up to the next level. I got him again, and he had a temper and and to this day, when he got up he would ride a bicycle about five miles just to come see me man come see me to see if I'd give him a beer, and I'd go \"no\". I'm not gonna give you a beer. But But anyway, that's and you make good relationships with people there too. And people come bank with me because you lose for me to somebody does good something good for my kid.

I have seen a lot of things. I can see how a molehill can turn into a mountain. I can see how you can get blindsided. So I- if there was if there was an Olympics for worrying, I- I would be first place most of the time, and particularly about my children. I don't want them making the same- And I've got one that just doesn't listen. never will. But, um- one of the hardest things that I've learned, I can't believe that I'm this old. That's the first thing. My brain. I can't get it in my head. My brain still thinks I'm 30 years old. And it tells my body: \"Oh, you can go cut that tree down and cut it up\". And about halfway through my body goes: \"You lied. You lied\". And so. So you my thinking hasn't changed until I look in a mirror I go \"oh man. who's that old guy?\" And so the hardest thing for me to do is remember, I can't do the things I once did i- You fool around and get hurt. And uh- my challenge when I was working was- um- I'm kind of competitive. And, uh- if I wasn't meeting goals, and if the branch wasn't meeting goals, I just agonized over it, and that probably took years off my life because I would worry about it because everybody wants to be a winner. You want to get you get patted on the back. I had- when I was at the bank that I told you about where the lady we were in a loan meeting one morning and one of the things she said track for the loan officers is your percentage of past dues. Percentage of loan if you've got a portfolio of- I think mine when I retired was approaching 40 million that I loaned out that was out on the books. If you're past dues that are 90- ur- that are 30 days- no, was it 60 to 90 days, past and more. If the percentage of that port- total portfolio you wanted it, ideally you wanted it under 2%. This bank that I worked for they were okay with three and a half percent. And of all the loan officers in that bank, mine, were always I was- mine my past dues. Were always I was a little. So in this loan meeting, the president of the bank **** **** again, he said, Well, Mr. We got that through over done. He said, \"Well, Mr. ***** you you've had some attaboys. Today, you got anything you want to say\". I said, I had been working at that time, I said, \"I've been working at the bank for 20 years, over 20 years. And one thing I've learned is that you can take a room full of attaboys. And all it takes is one Oh no. and they evaporatet\". He said \"you're exactly right\". And, and, and that probably was one of the toughest things. Because if you don't, if you don't, particularly with mortgage lending, it gets so complicated if you don't do the proper disclosures at the proper period of time, and, and so forth. The bank is- you can cost the bank money monetarily. And you can't, there are certain things you can't, you gotta be careful that you don't mislead them. You know, I mean, unintentionally, you would never do intentionally, but anyway, it's, it can be up from that standpoint. High pressure.so.

My first- my first choice is University of Texas, and I've always been always will be. So if University of Texas playing some other team inside Texas, I'm pulling for the Longhorns. But if the Aggies are playing some team over Louisiana, I'm gonna pull for the Aggies. If they've got Texas and in their name or a school in Texas, and they're playing somebody outside the state, then that's- I'm going to pull for the Texas Team every time. One of the reasons the: No you didn't ask me this. Maybe you are. My least favorite college team. And let me finish up my favorite professional team. I do the same thing: number ones the cowboys. Number two, though, I still pull when those two when they are- not the Warriors the Texans and and Dallas play. I'm usually don't pull from Dallas, unless it means that they're out of the playoffs, and Houston can get in the win, I'm probably gonna pull for Houston. I won't see him in the playoffs. But what I was gonna say about the college side of this. I do not care if the University of Oklahoma is playing tiddlywinks. I want them to lose. And here's the reason why. We had a good kid that was recruited by Texas, and Texas A&M, and Oklahoma and he ended up going to Oklahoma. This some years back, this is when Coach ***** was still alive. And I- and coach ****** told me where he was going. And I said, Well, here's what I'm gonna say about that. I hope he leads the league in tackles. I hope he never gets hurt. I hope he has an excellent season. And I hope he loses every game. And I've also made the statement that if there was a law passed that the University of Oklahoma could never, no, not ever recruit in the state of Texas, they wouldn't win three games a year, and why a kid from Texas.

Absolutely. Uh- I, uh- mowing the yard, my dad would we work shift work. And Saturday morning he would leave about 6:30 to go to the paper mill he'd wake me up and he'd say, and you get home about three 3:15 And he'd say I want this yard mowed when I get in. Now, it was amazing to me how quick three o'clock would roll around and I had not mowed. If I'm cranking belong mower I'm safe. But if I have not started the lawn mower, its trouble. And yeah, I had and I- we had chickens for a while I had to go the eggs and got in trouble for bustin eggs on a rooster that was mean. And, uh- and those kinds of things. And while we're talking here, I'll tell you a quick thing. My neighbors were kind of like my second set of grandparents, and I was probably 14 years old 15- 15 probably. And they were having hay cut. This field back here. And I was out there piddling around and the guy that was hauling in the hay and putting it in the barn. There's bales of hay, you know they didn't do round bales back then. He asked me he said \"hey, I need a little help you interested in making some money?\" And I went \"Yeah\", and I'd hauled some hay before a little bit. And so we hauled hay. I thought we would quit at dark and we didn't. We work until about 10:30. And I cam- I came dragging in, this is, and I'm telling this story because of my dad. This was the kind of guy he was. And I got a bath and he came in there and dragging and he said \"what time you got to be out there again in the morning?\" I said, \"I don't think I'm gonna go.\" And he said, \"Did you tell this fellow that you would help him with his field of hay?\" \"Yes, sir\". He said \"then you're gonna go\". He said \"you don't have to go to the next field. But he's relying on you help him get this hay in the barn\". Now you got to know. I was the youngest of the crew. I was last one home. And one of the worst jobs about hauling hay is they're outside throwing it into the crib to you and your inside of the crib. Where, there's no air, there's dust and stacking in it. And no wind, and that was a part of the job. And then so I'm out there the next day. And I grab a bale of hay and put it on my knee and I throw it up to the guy stacking it on the truck. And there's a half a snake the head half hanging out. And I almost tendered my- my resignation at that point. But I toughed it all out. And, uh- at the end of the week, I think I worked all week and I think I made 20 bucks or something like that. And the guy said \"you want to go the next field\" I went \"uh- No, I think my hay haulin days are over\". But it was a good lesson though, I never committed to doing a job, again.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_lufkin_nr/canvas/3#t=2531,2714"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_lufkin_nr/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"out of these chores, what would you say is the worst chore?

I didn't like gathering the eggs because this rooster we had he would try to spur you. I mean, he tried to jump and flog you and, and you had to get a stick to get in the chicken yard and keep him at bay. Now for some reason, he wouldn't come in the chicken house. And so I could get in there gather eggs. And usually I didn't have very many I could take my stick and get back to the gate get out. Well, just one day I had a bunch of eggs. I couldn't get my stick and I'm looking out the door, and I don't see him. And I hit it for the gate. And he's laying in wait. And here he comes. I grab an egg. And I busted it on his back. And he backs off of me, and then I grab another one before I'm thinking and I hit him again. He starts running, and I hit him again. And I got chicken squawking and I got egg yolk hang in there. And dad hears the commotion comes out. There he goes. And then he spoke to me about busting eggs. And uh- that was not a good conversation. So I hated that rooster finally ended up in a dumpling pot. And it was happy day for me. But, but I didn't like that. But then one time, we had an old timey septic system, we didn't have the aerobic system and that old ground where we lived was really not suitable wasn't very sandy. And so we were always having trouble with that thing and dad called a guy to have the septic tank pumped out and the guys they couldn't get there and we were having problems and he he said \"we're gonna get out here and dip this thing out.\" And I went: \"huh? no, Surely not.\" And he said \"yes.\" So he had a little trailer behind the lawn mower and some cans and garbage and rubber gloves. And so we we dipped it out. So I had some chores I wasn't particularly fond of doing. He also had me one time he raised a garden every year, every year every year. And we had this little walk behind tractor two wheeled tractor. And he- he was had a turning plow. And then one February, he said I need you to, uh- break up the garden. I said, Okay. And he said, I've got something he's going to be working on something else. And this tractors little tractor thing, had a pulley that stuck out from the engine with a notch in it. You had a rope with a wooden handle on it, you wrapped it around that and you yanked on it. And that's how you cranked it. It was cold. It was it was a cold day. And my ears were cold. And sometimes the thing would kind of backfire and that knot would slip out. Well that happened that day and it popped me on my ear. And I take- before I think about it, I take this starting rope and I'll start beating on the tractor. Just waling away, waling away. And I look up and there's my dad looking at me and he says- he said \"did that help?\" \"Well, it helps me\". He said \"well get through with it and get busy\".  I said \"Okay\", but anyway, those are some of the chores there was a bunch of others he always had, I made the mistake of telling him one time I was bored.

I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County, and when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time, we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and would swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. Pretending to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring, I'd fly kites, and on summer nights, we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corncobs or pine cones. In the winter, we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19, I went to work in Dallas in a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite food: fried okra, hoppin john, that's rice and Black Eyed Peas, and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, mom sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texans.

And so the words they used were different. As a matter of fact, I wrote a- of course since I wrote a thing the other day that I said something to my wife, or somebody that was here. And I said- I said they stay just a second? And they left? And I said \"why don't you come after a coal of fire?\" And she looked at and went \"what are you talking about?\" Now I thought you know a lot of folks might not know this. But in the old days, in those days, in his days, all the head for heat was fireplace. And if you ran out of matches, or you couldn't afford matches, which might have been the case many times all you ur- to start to get a fire going again, the thing you did was you go down to the neighbor and ask for a coal of his fire. But you couldn't stay, you had to get the coal and get back before it went out. So they had those kinds of sayings and, and I picked up some of them, and my wife, one of one of the other ones I'll tell you and move on. Let me back up for a second and tell you about you know, and my grandfather would be one of those people that you said was- he believed the Earth was flat. didn't believe a man went on the moon. And the reason he did he'd have my dad read the Bible to him from time to time when we go down there. And he said \"the Bible speaks to the four corners of the earth\". And what it's talking about is north, south, east, and the west. But that's not the way he saw it. He said you can't make a circle out of a square if there's four corners. There's not a circle. So that was his rationale on that. But he was honest as the day was long. And my point in this and I wanted to say this is: while he was not educated as you would think of being educated, He could tell you when to plant, How deep to plant, Which cow is most likely to have a calf, Which cow is most likely produce the most milk. He possessed knowledge, that I don't possess that will help you live if you had to, in a different world without electricity and stuff. They had- they had some. But one of the other things and then I'll stop because there's a bunch of them, but we were talking about. Some of us were talking about where to go eat after church one day. And my dad said, I'd ask him, I said, \"Dad where do you want to go\", he said, \"I'm kind of like a sounds mule. I'll work either side of the tongue.\" Now, do you have any idea what he's talking about?","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_lufkin_nr/canvas/3#t=3399,3637"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_lufkin_nr/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"No.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Interviewer","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_lufkin_nr/canvas/3#t=3637,3638"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_lufkin_nr/canvas/3/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"My wife didn't either. Well, here's- here's the deal. When the old days when you had a wagon, and you had two mules, mules can be stubborn. And many, many times a mule would only work on the left side of the wagon tongue, and he only worked or the other one would only work when you couldn't make them switch out. wouldn't do it. But you find a new work either side, now he's easy going. And so there's, they want to know about, you know, what, old sayings? Those are a couple. And- and I don't know if these are some that my dad brought over. But his- I've written down some of his. He has a bunch of them. One of them was when I'd do something foolish, which was often. He would, he'd look at me, and he goes \"Son, If you fell in the river, I'd go upstream to look for you.

I said- I said \"That guy is just a rat dad, he's, he's not fair\". Then he said, \"Hey, first of all, life's not fair. And if you want fair, you're going to have to wait till October. That's when it comes to town. Cause that's the only fair I know. And the other thing I'm going to tell you is two horses behinds have never made a horse. One of you have got to be the head and do the thinking. Is that going to be you?\" And, I'll try, and that ain't always easy. But good advice. I've got a bunch if you want more but thats- my grandpa told my cousin one time, he was helping him in the garden. He thought he was doing a good thing. But he was trying to make it look nice and he's over here, Hoeing not not hoeing the row. Pa ***** looked at him and he said, \"Son, you lose a crop hoeing in the corner of the garden\". And I thought you know, that's good advice. It looks nice, but you're not doing anything productive. You're just piddling, and so he, uh- he was he was in many ways was a really a smart fella. And he- he was at a brush arbor meeting one time and this is my dad's story. He said he was a stout. He wasn't real tall. My dad's mom's family was 6'3-6'4. So my dad was six one, I'm about six. But Pa ***** was probably 5'10''. Maybe no more. But he was stocky and strong. And they went to this brush arbor meeting and the preacher was going on and on and on. And, uh- Pa had to go to the bathroom. So he got up and was working his way out to go I guess up behind a tree I don't know, And the preacher said, \"Ah ha, there goes one that got his corn shelled.\" made Pa mad. Pa looked at him. He said \"Tell you what feller. You come down the road a little ways. I'll shell your corn.\" so he was sometimes no nonsense. He told me I don't have it on me right now. He would, uh- We went to see him one time, and he's he always kept yellow handled case pocket knife. And he was sharpening it kept it razor sharp, and he was sharpening it when I got up there and he was showing me how to do it. And all. And he said, he said \"Now let me tell you\". That's the other way he was wise. He said \"you get your mama. You see if you get you one of these knives, get your mama to put a baked potato in the oven and get it hot and when it's hot. Stick that knife in and leave it so long\". forgotten how long he said \"take it out, hit it a few licks, put it in cold water and do it again\" and he said \"it'll be set and you'll hold edge\". I said, \"Okay\". And he said, \" But let me show you\" he said\" you need one of these\". He said, \"first of all case makes a good knife\". He said, \"second of all, the reason you want a yellow handle case is because if you drop it in the woods, you never will find a bone handle in them leaves, you will find this yellow handle one, pretty easy\". I've carried a yellow handle case for years. What my Pa ***** told me. And so, um- they- I have a life insurance lessons, and I had to go to these seminars to maintain the continue of education. And this guy was talking about investments and how the people- many people retire at poverty level and you need to diversify your portfolio and stuff, and I said- at the end of the day, I said-  \"You know, I have a grandfather that probably he qualifies poverty level.\" I said. \"But let me tell you something about him. He didn't care the first thing about going to Hawaii. He didn't even want to go to Houston. I said one time we were coming back from Houston, and he and I were to see his brother and there's two things I remember about that trip I was probably 10 years old. And one of them was we just got finally got out of the Houston traffic and he said \"I'm gonna tell you one thing if **** will see me he'll come to ****\" or ***** he lived out of *****. He said \" I ain't coming back this place\". We we got to the end- to the Neches River Bridge. And when we got across the bridge. He looked over at me that notion he said \"we back in the United States now son\"\" that's the way he saw it. But he was he was a fine fella and my dad was is as good as gold. My mom was super I've written some stories, written a lot of them I need to keep the bottle them together of things that they've done but but they they talked all together different. I mean, it was the deep south, you know, but I was very fortunate. I had um- my mother's- My mother was a ****** and she grew up in the **** area. And my grandpa ******* old place was a rock house right across from **** school. He used to raise crops where **** school sits. I don't know that that was his land. But he did that. And his name was Harold ******. I wasn't as close to him he- Pa pa was kind of a gruff- not as open as my grandpa ***** and me. We got along and all that. But he worked on- he played fiddle. Oh, he could play a fiddle. I have it I ended up with it. can't play it, but I've got it. But , uh-anyway. Well, I I like to talk I've got plenty of stories and good things. But I hope that was kind of what you were looking for on that.
