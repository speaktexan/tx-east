And as a part of this project, a linguistic researcher is asking that interview participants read a brief passage which should only take a couple minutes. It's a short, made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s. And since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few hundred Texans reading it and they use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech changes over time.

Okay. \"I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree and we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we'd call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the morning we'd build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 and went to work in Dallas at a Firestone tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods, fried okra, hoppin john- that's rice and black eyed peas- and pecan pie. We had lots of good times we're going home. It's not the same now. After daddy died, mine was sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talking about moving to the country. My oldest child says \"Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I try to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land have a sense of place and take pride to be Texans.
