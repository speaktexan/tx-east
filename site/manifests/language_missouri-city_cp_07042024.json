So one of the overarching research questions through this program is about linguistic changes in Texas. So as part of this project, a linguistic researchers asking that our interview participants read this brief passage, which would only take a couple of minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas, and how it was created in the 1980s. And since then, the linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading this. So they use these recordings as samples of people standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time.

At least they weren't on my head this time. [SIGHS] Okay. I've lived in Texas all my life. I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is in southeast Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse climb trees are hot and down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb on a cypress tree and would swing out wide over the of the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring. I'd fly kites and on summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while would have fights with corn cobs or pine cones in the winter would build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess it was alive wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra hoppin john, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved taller. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I just die if I had to live on a farm. I almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But our I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we many in the live in the city. I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land. Have a sense of place and take pride in being Texans.
