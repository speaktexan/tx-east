You understand what I'm saying? You just\ncan't take off when you're a first responser. So nobody was prepared for this. Not even the kids, not\nbeing able to see different. So you look at this.

Not able to see they friends; not even to talk to\nthem because all kids didn't have cell phones. And then it came where okay, they decided to give them,\nthe year before, but- nobody had the internet when they needed the tablet when school started. So\nsome parents couldn't afford the internet.

I'm going back- and we'd swing out wide over the\nswimming hole and drops into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In, in the spring\nI'd fly kites, and on the summer nights we catch fireflies, but we call them \"lightening bugs\". Once in a\nwhile- I'm trying to see for you- we'd have fights with our corn cobs and pinecones. In the winter we'd\nbuild a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was, I guess I\nwas, I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work into Dallas at a Firestone tire store. I didn't like city\nlife, and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods:\nfried okra, Hoppin', Hoppin' John, what kind? Hoppin' John, that the rice and black eyed peas, and\npecan pie. We had lots, lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died,\nMama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the\ncity, but my wife and kids don't understand me when I grip about, gripe about city life and talk about\nmoving to the country. My oldest child said, \"Daddy that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm.\" I\nalmost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing but I try to make sure we don't lose\ntouch with our, our roots. While meanwhile, while we may live in the city, I want my kids to have a good\nfeeling for the land, have a sense of place, and take pride in being Texans.
