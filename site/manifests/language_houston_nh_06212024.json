Alright, sounds good. So thank you so much for your answers. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me if you have time. I just have one last request for you before we conclude our interview, one of the overarching research questions through the Home to Texas program is about linguistic changes in Texas. As part of this project on linguistic researchers asking that interview participants read a brief passage which should only take a couple minutes. It's a short made up story about life in Texas that was created in the 1980s, and since then, linguistic researchers have recorded a few 100 Texans reading it. They use these recordings as samples of people's standard way of speaking as they try to track how speech in Texas varies and changes over time. Would you be willing to read a brief passage out loud?  ","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Interviewer","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_houston_nh_06212024/canvas/7#t=923,967"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_houston_nh_06212024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Yes. ","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_houston_nh_06212024/canvas/7#t=967,968"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_houston_nh_06212024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"All right.

I was born in Titus County. And when I was five, we moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I like growing up in the country. [PAPER RUSTLING]. When my chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees, or hike down to the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree. And we'd swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I'd pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In the spring, I'd like I- I'd fly kites. And on, summer nights we'd catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter, we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a live wire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone Tire store. I didn't like city life and for a long time I'd go home every chance I got. Mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra hoppin' john, that rice and black eyed peas, and pecan pie. We had a lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy died, Mama sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of here in the city. But my wife and kids don't understand me when I gripe about city life and talk about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I'd just die if I had to live on a farm. I'd almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing, but I tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land, have a sense of place and take pride of being Texans. If they lose our ties to the land. The price of progress is too high.  ","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_houston_nh_06212024/canvas/7#t=975,1103"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_houston_nh_06212024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"All right, thank you for contributing your voice to the collection, and thank you so much for taking the time to share your experiences with me.
