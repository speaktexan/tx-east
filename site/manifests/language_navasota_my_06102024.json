I was born in Cabarrus County, and when I was five, I moved to a farm near White House, which is southeast of Tyler. I liked growing up in the country. My chores were done, I'd ride my horse, climb trees or hike down the creek to fish or swim. One time we tied a rope to a limb of a cypress tree, and we swing out wide over the swimming hole and drop into the water. I pretend to be Tarzan swinging on a vine. In spring I fly kites and on summer nights we catch fireflies, but we call them lightning bugs. Once in a while we'd have fights with corn cobs or pine cones. In the winter we build a fire in the fireplace and pop popcorn and roast peanuts and pecans. I guess I was a Livewire. When I was 19 I went to work in Dallas at a Firestone car store. I didn't like city life. For a long time I'd go home every chance I've got mama would always cook my favorite foods fried okra. Papa John, that's rice and black eyed peas and pecan pie. We had lots of good times, but going home is not the same now. After daddy dad mom sold the farm and moved to Tyler. I'd rather be living on a farm right now instead of out here in the city. My wife and kids don't understand me when I grew up about city life and talking about moving to the country. My oldest child says Daddy, that's crazy. I just died. I have to live on the farm. almost cried the first time she said that. I know Texas is changing. But I've tried to make sure we don't lose touch with our roots. While we may live in a city, I want my kids to have a good feeling for the land have a sense of place and take pride and be in Texas. If they lose our ties and land the price of progress is too high.\" ","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7#t=1569,1706"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Alright, thank you very much.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Interviewer","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7#t=1681,1682"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Mhm.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7#t=1682,1683"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Okay, um,","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Interviewer","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7#t=1683,1684"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"And I  didn't say \"pee-cans\", I said \"pecans\" [INAUDIBLE]","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7#t=1684,1686"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"[LAUGHS] Alright.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Interviewer","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7#t=1686,1689"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Are you, are you a Texan from,","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7#t=1689,1690"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Oh yeah, I was born here.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Interviewer","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7#t=1690,1691"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Yeah.","format":"text/plain","motivation":"commenting"},{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Participant","format":"text/plain","purpose":"tagging","motivation":"tagging"}],"target":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7#t=1691,1691"},{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","type":"Annotation","motivation":["commenting","tagging"],"id":"https://speaktexan.github.io/tx-east/language_navasota_my_06102024/canvas/7/page1","body":[{"type":"TextualBody","value":"Yeah, yeah.
